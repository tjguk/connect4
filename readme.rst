Connect 4
=========

For the London Python Dojo back in September, we challenged ourselves to produce a Connect4
game. Most teams opted for a list-of-lists approach of one sort or another. Afterwards, I
wondered what would happen if I tried a dictionary-based approach instead. And this is
the work-in-progress of that solution.
